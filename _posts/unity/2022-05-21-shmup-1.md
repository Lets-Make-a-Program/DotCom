Many, many years ago, I was working on a shmup.  For the uninitiated, a "shmup" (short for shoot-em-up) is a genre of video game where you control some kind of vessel and dodge enemy shots while trying to shoot down the enemies themselves.  It started with things like Galaga and has mostly fallen out of favor, but there are plenty of die-hard shmup lovers out there.

I wanted to make a game - any game, really - and decided to make a shmup because the gameplay is relatively simple.
