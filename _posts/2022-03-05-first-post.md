title: First Blog Post From Netlify
subtitle: "AKA: New Platform, Who Dis?"
---

I have been managing my developer page using a Jekyll template and hosting it on Netlify rather than using GitHub's default Pages setup.
In an effort to reduce the cognitive load of managing that site *and* this one, I am cooking up a big pot of copy pasta and switching this
site over to use the same setup.

As with any migration, I will need to break some bones in order to set them properly, so things may look funky for a little
while.  Once it is all said and done, however, I will have two sites with a common setup that will make it easy to switch back and forth.

The plan is to alternate posts each week.  Either I'll post on my dev site - usually with more soft skills advice and personal gripes - or
I will post here - generally with something more technical.  So, stay tuned, and "🚧 excuse our mess 🚧" as I get things switched over.
