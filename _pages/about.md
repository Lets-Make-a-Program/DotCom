## About the Site
*Let's Make a Program* is a site that exists for two main reasons:
- To teach new coders by doing things with them
- To ["learn in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/){:target="_blank"} by blogging while trying new things

This site is not academic, and the programs / tutorials will not be perfect.  But that's the point - we'll all learn together by *writing code*.

## About the Author
I'm [Noah Wright](https://noahwright.dev){:target="_blank"}, and I've been programming since I was a kid.  These days, I've got a degree and a bunch of professional experience, but I started out as a self-taught developer.

Early on, I came across a tutorial for writing a shmup.  It walked me through each step, made some mistakes along the way, then corrected those mistakes.  That way of learning gave me a much better understanding of the code I had written, and I hope to replicate that sort of learning experience on this site.
